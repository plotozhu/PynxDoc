We are excited to finish a full-shard public blockchain system to provide high TPS performance on home network. We have developed a prototype blockchain which reached 64K TPS on 10M bps network and want it to be challenged and proved to be practical for Filecoin.

# 2
We want get bug fixes, suggestions, improvements and proposal apis for this full-shard blockchain, which will guide us to finish a full-shard implementation and maybe helpful for next generation of Filecoin.
